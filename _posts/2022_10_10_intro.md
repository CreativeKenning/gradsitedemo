Is something connective if it goes nowhere?

Since first studying Discord in my masters programs I was troubled by the extant literature on protest mobilization. Not so much that there was anything *wrong* with the theory: they all were excellent, insightful, both scientific and rooted in personal action. However, their analysis, theories, and assumptions, are excellent models of the political uses of platforms from 2014.

My contention, then, is that these models are being utilized to uncritically inform recent work on platform ecosystems and protest mobilization both. And  as for the platforms I study--those I am half-convinced are reperesentative of the direction of the internet in the coming years--they are continually treated as afterthoughts to the real connective web, or the places were extremists go to fester.

"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of."

"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.

"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."

"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.

"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him."
