title: What even is Connectivity?

How do we engage with Connectivity in an internet that is mo


Since first studying Discord in my masters programs I was troubled by the extant literature on protest mobilization. Not so much that there was anything *wrong* with the theory: they all were excellent, insightful, both scientific and rooted in personal action. However, their analysis, theories, and assumptions, are excellent models of the political uses of platforms from 2014.

My contention, then, is that these models are being utilized to uncritically inform recent work on platform ecosystems and protest mobilization both. For example, in ___ *The Logic of Connective Action*, they don't even *define* connectivity, even though connectivity as a concept is central to their work: it's just assumed to be part and parcel with the web. 

At the same time, the platforms I study--those I am half-convinced are reperesentative of the direction of the internet in the coming years--are decidedly *not* connective in the traditional sense--insoafar as they do not curate user discourse to other users-- and are continually treated as afterthoughts to the real connective web, or the places were extremists go to fester.

A guiding principle of my work is to complicate our definitions of blanket connectivity through closer study of platforms like Discord and Telegram
