title: "A look Back: CSNSLL on Discord"
---

Hello to the various folks reading this post, today I'm reflecting on a past project, one that is (mostly) outside of my interest: linguistics.

Apologies to all the liguists out there, but my experience in lingusiics was not ideal. I was required ot take at least *one& linguistics credit to complete my masters, and so I settled on Global Englishes. While very important work, much of that course was focused on pedagogy. With no interest in teaching composition, and no experience with ESL teaching, I was out of my depth in more ways than one.

So, the challenge for me was to connect Global Englishes to my work on Discord. Luckily, after some cursory searching, I found that there was an active series of Discord servers dedicated to teaching English as a second language.

I likely won't publishe my findings, as it would require ex-post-facto IRB approval.
