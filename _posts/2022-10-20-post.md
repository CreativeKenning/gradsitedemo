title: "A look Back: CSNSLL on Discord"
---

Hello to the various folks reading this post, today I'm reflecting on a past project, one that is (mostly) outside of my interest: linguistics.

Apologies to all the liguists out there, but my experience in lingusiics was not ideal. I was required ot take at least *one& linguistics credit to complete my masters, and so I settled on Global Englishes. While very important work, much of that course was focused on pedagogy. With no interest in teaching composition, and no experience with ESL teaching, I was out of my depth in more ways than one.

Looking for some familiar footing, I decided to look at the types of language-learning platforms were out there, and found a sizeable amount of work on SNSLLs: Social Networking Sites for Language Learning. These sites were tailor built social networks whcih connected language-learners, allowing them to practice conversation, and motivate each other (Alvarez).

However, I found that there was less work out there on language learning as it took place on pre-existing social networks ala Discord. Sensing an opportunity, I started my analysis with this question: how do people learn language on Discord? What language-ideologuies inform said learning?

So, the challenge for me was to connect Global Englishes to my work on Discord. Luckily, after some cursory searching, I found that there was an active series of Discord servers dedicated to teaching English as a second language.

I likely won't publishe my findings, as it would require ex-post-facto IRB approval.
