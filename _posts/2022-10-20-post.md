title: "A look Back: CSNSLL on Discord"
---

Hello to the various folks reading this post, today I'm reflecting on a past project, one that is (mostly) outside of my interest: linguistics.

Apologies to all the liguists out there, but my experience in lingusiics was not ideal. I was required ot take at least *one* linguistics credit to complete my masters, and so I settled on Global Englishes. While very important work, much of that course was focused on pedagogy. With no interest in teaching composition, and no experience with ESL teaching, I was out of my depth in more ways than one.

Looking for some familiar footing, I decided to look at the types of language-learning platforms were out there, and found a sizeable amount of work on SNSLLs: Social Networking Sites for Language Learning. These sites were tailor built social networks whcih connected language-learners, allowing them to practice conversation, and motivate each other (Alvarez).

However, I found that there was less work out there on language learning as it took place on pre-existing social networks ala Discord. Sensing an opportunity, I started my analysis with this question: how do people learn language on Discord? What language-ideologies inform said learning?

I began by scraping the first 10 apges of language-learning community advertisements on the third-party site disboard, and analyzing the community-made interfaces and affordances therein. (If you're interested in this scraper, check out the [D/ARC!](https://darcmode.org/)) On the recommendation of the professor, I narrowed my analysis to the communities themselves.

So, the challenge for me was to connect Global Englishes to my work on Discord. Luckily, after some cursory searching, I found that there was an active series of Discord servers dedicated to teaching English as a second language. And, not suprisingly, in the largest of these servers, Native-speakers were given authority in their community, through multiple interface/affordance design choices. 

I likely won't publishe my findings, as it would require ex-post-facto IRB approval. However, it was a lesson for me in two regards: 1. I should not have listened to my professor, and did the method that would have let me PUBLISH afterwards, and 2. It let me see first-hand the flexibility of private messaging apps in networking their users, informing my ongoing work on Discord and Telegram.
