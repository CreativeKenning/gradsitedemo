title: Mapping Discord's Darkside, Distributed Hate-Networks on Disboard
description: An exploration of Discord's technoculture using data collected from the third-party search board, Disboard.
---

In the early parts of 2020, I had a problem. I was looking to make an argument about connectivity (following ther work of Jose Van Djick) and non-connective messaging apps like Discord. However, as an early Grad student with little IRB experience, I had no way of actually studying Discord's communities. In searching for information on Discord, I stumbled on the technically-unaffilaited third-party invite hosting and search site, Disboard. A cursory search revealed serious and unaddressed problems with Discord's technoculture: specifically in their continued networking of white-supremacist and hate groups. With a new research goal in view, and technical guidance from my co-author [PS Berge](https://psberge.com/), we scraped Disboard to in order to critique Discord's reliance on unmoderated third-party services, and point to the necessity of studying platform ecosystems, as opposed to primary-platforms alone. Our work can be found in [New Media and Society](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448211062548), and I've included the abstract below:


Mapping Discord's Darkside: Abstract
------------
>Discord, a popular community chat application, has rhetorically distanced itself from its associations with white supremacist content through a public commitment to proactive moderation. However, Discord relies extensively on third-party services (like bots and server bulletins), which have been overlooked in their role in facilitating hateful networks. This study notes how Discord offloads searchability to server bulletin sites like Disboard, to deleterious effect. This study involves two parts: (1) we use critical technoculture discourse analysis to examine Discord’s blogs, policies, and application programming interface and (2) we present data scraped from 2741 Discord servers listed on Disboard, revealing networks of hateful and white supremacist communities that openly use “edgy,” raiding-oriented, and toxic messaging. These servers exploit Discord’s moderation tools and affordances to proliferate within Discord’s distributed ecology. We argue that Discord’s policies fail to address its reliance on unmoderated third-party services or the networked practices of its toxic communities.
