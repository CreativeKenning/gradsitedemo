Discord Acaedmic Research Community: the D/ARC
============
![darc](/gradsitedemo/assets/images/darc.png "playful pedagogy")
After [publishing](https://mobatta2.github.io/gradsitedemo/projects/mappingdiscordsdarkside/){:target="_blank"} one of the first large-scale analysis of Discord's technoculture, me and PS were intimately aware with both the difficulties and importance of studying Discord and similar messaging apps. Following PS' lead, I joined them and [Hibby Thach](https://www.hibbythach.com/), [Rachel Berryman](https://rachelberryman.com/research/phd), and [Nick-Brie](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/guarr003) as a co-founder and moderator of the D/ARC: a community dedicating to supporting fellow scholars in their study of Discord and Discord communities. With a curated Zotero library, workshops with publishers, conference submission support, Discord and Disboard scrapers, and general technical advice, we strive to create a welcoming space for scholars at all stages of their career to assist and be assisted by their fellows. If you're interested in Discord research, or just a welcoming community of fellow scholars, [Come join us!](http://darcmode.org/). We'd be happy to welcome you there! And wIth over 500 members you'll be sure to find resources and support to further your practice and career.
