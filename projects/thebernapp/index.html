<p>Beginning with my frustration at the design of the BERN app, I theorize that private pseudonyomous, webhook integrated spaces (ala Telegram and Discord), can provide the motivating structures for webhook-mediated app-based activism. This article is currently being revised for submission.</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is little doubt among platform studies and communication scholars that our current moment is one of upheaval: the continued growth of right-wing extremism, the violent storming of the U.S. capitol building, QAnon, the pandemic… Disruption—political and otherwise—is the norm of the coming decade, a fact whose implications have caused further adoption of platforms in our day-today lives and drawn further scholarly attention on the often-extremist movements fomenting in the depths of as-of-yet little studied spaces. While there is growing scholarly attention to alternative social media such as Telegram and Discord in networking extremists, there is little consensus on how to talk about these alternative social media, positioned as algorithmically uncurated nodes within larger media networks. Drawing from platform studies, procedural rhetoric, and rhetorical realism, this study approaches the rise of alternative social media platforms and their unique affordances from their positive political potential, as opposed to their usage in organizing fascist movements.  Beginning with an analysis of the BERN app and the failed Bernie Sanders campaign, this study charts the ways in which the “gamified” BERN app failed to provide a persuasive motivating structure for user engagement. This study then proposes that the very affordances we see utilized in alternative social media to motivate communities of fandoms, activists, streamers, and extremists, are the very affordances that should be actively integrated into the infrastructures of progressive political movements.  As such, this study proposes the potential of private, algorithmically un-curated social media to act as motivating supraplatforms for activist engagement and argues that social organizing applications such as the BERN app should seriously consider these affordances as powerful tools for political persuasion.</p>
